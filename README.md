# soracom-mkr-iot-alarm

This example reads a Seeed Studio Ultrasonic Grove sensor and publishes a JSON message to the Soracom Unified endpoint when an object is within a specified range. 

When Soracom Funk is configured on a Group, the message can be published to an AWS Lambda function to kick off an email alert. The function can be modified to perform custom operations, such as posting to a Slack webhook.
